===========================

This is the GitHub repo for the my camera drawing sample for the "Creative, Serious and Playful Science of Android Apps 
by Lawrence Angrave" Coursera course.  This sample lets you take a picture, draw whatever you like on it and finally saving this to the device gallery.
