Apps101CourseraCameraSample
===========================

This is the GitHub repo for the my camera drawing sample for the "Creative, Serious and Playful Science of Android Apps 
by Lawrence Angrave" Coursera course.  This sample lets you take a picture, draw whatever you like on it and finally save this file to the device image gallery.

Note:  This sample is severely lacking in error checking due to the need for simplicity in a sample for absolute beginners.  In addition, some things that 
should be done concurrently (no problem for modern phones but older ones may experience ANRs) are done on the UI thread, also for simplicity's sake.
